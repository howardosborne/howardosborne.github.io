### What is performance testing?
You probably have a good idea of whether your software is functional and maybe how well it performs when running in a development environment. But how well will it cope when:
- fully populated with data?
- under typical or peak load?
- under expectional stress, perhaps a denial of serivce attack?

What will be the impact on users and our data?

Performance testing focusses on answering these questions.

We do it by designing a series of tests which shows how the systems deals with different circumstances. Typicall tests are:
- Normal operation
- peak load
- soak with spikes (and manual exploratory window) 
- stress tests.

#### data and environment
But testing will tell you little unless the system under test is populated with a realisitic set of data and is deployed to an environment that is realistic or one that inferences can be drawn from. Helping generate data to both drive tests and populate systems is a key activity.

#### monitoring
If it doesn't, I'll help identify where the issues are and resolve them.

Of course, it's better if they don't happen in the first place, so I'll help you to bake good practice into the design, development and test process.

It also isn't always possible to test things to the extent we would like, so I can help to use limited testing to see further than your tests can show.

#### Testing Tools
Doing this has meant working with a wide range of technologies and so I can help you choose the best fit for your organisation.

It's usually good to work with tools that are widely known and supported, which is why JMeter often comes out on top.

However, a tool to execute tests is only part of the picture. Additional bits and pieces are usually need to be made to analyse, monitor and build test environments.

But sometimes, other tools are more suitable and occasionally, there is only one choice - make the right tool for the job.
