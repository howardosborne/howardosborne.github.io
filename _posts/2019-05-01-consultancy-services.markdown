I specialise in improving the quality of software and infrastrucutre by providing:

### Performance testing
I work with a wide range of technologies depending on providing the best fit.

It's usually good to work with tools that are widely known and supported, which is why JMeter often comes out on top.

But sometimes, other tools are more suitable and occasionally, there is only one choice - make the right tool for the job.


#### Automation
Providing simple, reliable automation that won't give you a maintnence headache
Using the tools that are best for the job and the team.

#### Investigation and optimisation
If you know you have a problem but don't know where to start, together we can work through how to turn around poor performance and unreliability

#### Training
Getting people up to speed so they can work with confidence and take your systems to new levels

#### Management
I've had to builds teams and provide leadership with a strong emphasis on mentoring.

Want to go through a problem or just get some advice? - Happy to talk it through...
