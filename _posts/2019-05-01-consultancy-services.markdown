I specialise in optimising software quality and the infrastructure it's deployed to. Here's how:
 
### Performance testing
I help organisations identify performance issues and how they can resolve them by introducing good performance testing practice.

### Automation
The automation graveyard is full of well meaning projects. I can help by providing simple, reliable automation that won't give you a maintenance headache - all using the tools that make the best fit for the job and the team.
 
### Investigation and optimisation
If you know you have a problem but don't know where to start, together we can work through how to turn around poor performance and unreliability.
 
### Training
I can help get people up to speed so they can work with confidence through training that is designed to meet their needs.

### Health checks
People, pets, cars, boilers and IT systems all benefit from a health check. 2-3 days is usually enough to identify what is working well and what could do with a bit of maintenance.

### Management
I've built teams and provided leadership with a strong emphasis on mentoring to deliver tried and tested systems.
