I specialise in optimising software quality and the infrastructre it's deployed to in the following ways:

### Performance testing
I help organisations identify performance issues and how they can resolve them by introducing good performance testing practice.

Want to learn more about [performance testing?](../performance-testing/)

### Automation
The automation graveyard is full of well meaning projects. I can help by providing simple, reliable automation that won't give you a maintnence headache - all using the tools that are best for the job and the team.

### Investigation and optimisation
If you know you have a problem but don't know where to start, together we can work through how to turn around poor performance and unreliability.

### Training
I can help get people up to speed so they can work with confidence and take your systems to new levels.

### Management
I've built teams and provided leadership with a strong emphasis on mentoring.

Want to go through a problem or just get some advice? - Happy to talk it through...
