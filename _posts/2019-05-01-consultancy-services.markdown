I specialise in improving the quality of software and infrastrucutre by doing the following things:

#### Performance testing
I can help make sure that your solution will scale well. If it doesn't, I'll help identify where the issues are and help resolve them. Of course, it's better if they don't happen in the first place, so I'll help you to bake good practie into the design, development and test process.

I have worked with a wide range of technologies and recommend using whatever makes the best fit for your organisation.

Nevertheless, it's usually good to work with tools that are widely known and supported, which is why JMeter often comes out on top.

However, a tool to execute tests is only part of the picture. Additional bits and pieces are usually need to be made to analyse, monitor and build test environments.


But sometimes, other tools are more suitable and occasionally, there is only one choice - make the right tool for the job.


#### Automation
Providing simple, reliable automation that won't give you a maintnence headache
Using the tools that are best for the job and the team.

#### Investigation and optimisation
If you know you have a problem but don't know where to start, together we can work through how to turn around poor performance and unreliability

#### Training
Getting people up to speed so they can work with confidence and take your systems to new levels

#### Management
I've had to builds teams and provide leadership with a strong emphasis on mentoring.
